# LarssonLibPublic
Hopsan component library made by L. Viktor Larsson (github user larsviktorlarsson)

All components in this library are under development. Feel free to use, but please be aware of the risk that they may not work properly and that the support is limited. 

The library in the main branch of https://github.com/Hopsan/development-libraries.git should always be compilable.

The absolute newest version of the library is found in the branch lvLarssonPublicLib in the https://github.com/larsviktorlarsson/development-libraries.git repo (fork of the official repo), but combilability is then not guaranteed.
